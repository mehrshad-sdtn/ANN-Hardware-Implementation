# ANN-Hardware-Implementation
(final project for Digital System Design course at Shahid Beheshti University instructed by Dr. Ali Jahanian) <br>
The implementation of an Artificial Neural Network in VHDL with 2 hidden layers of sizes 32 and 10 (output layer) <br>
This implementation is only the feed forward part of a neural network which does the prediction
sigmoid activation was used for both layers and it was implemented using [this approximation](https://mail.uotechnology.edu.iq/dep-eee/papers/Implementation%20of%20a%20Sigmoid%20Activation%20function%20for%20Neural%20N.pdf)
