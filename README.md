# ANN-Hardware-Implementation
(final project for Digital System Design course at Shahid Beheshti University instructed by Dr. Ali Jahanian)
The implementation of an Artificial Neural Network in VHDL with 2 hidden layers of sizes 32 and 10 (output layer)
This implementation is only the feed forward part of a neural network which does the prediction
